Each Gym can have up to six <a href=\"https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pokémon</a> assigned to defend it. Trainers from an opposing team can challenge the defenders with six of their own Pokémon, in hopes of claiming the Gym for their own <a href=\"https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Team\" title=\"Team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">team</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Details\">Details<a href=\"2019/09/08/What-Do-You-Get-From-Pokemon-Go-Gym?#Details\"></a></h2><p>A Pokémon’s ability to be successful in battle is primarily influenced by its <a href=\"https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon#Hit_Points\" title=\"Pokémon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hit Points</a> (HP) and <a href=\"https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_Power\" title=\"Combat Power\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Combat Power</a> (CP).</p>\n<p>Every Pokémon on a Gym has Motivation, a measurement of the Pokémon’s desire to defend the location. Trainers from opposing teams battle to reduce the motivation of the Pokémon on the Gym. Pokémon gradually lose motivation over time and by losing battles against opposing team members. As a Pokémon loses motivation, its CP will temporarily decrease, making it weaker in battle. When a Pokémon’s motivation reaches zero, it leaves the Gym and returns to its Trainer.</p>\n<p>For Gyms controlled by a team, their goal is to keep motivation up by giving the Pokémon treats. For Gyms controlled by opposing teams, their goal is to gain control of the Gym by depleting the motivation of opposing team’s Pokémon. Each trainers can leave only one Pokémon to defend each of their Gyms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue Gyms are controlled by <a href=\"https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Teams#Team_Mystic\" title=\"Teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Team Mystic</a>.</li>\n<li>Red Gyms are controlled by <a href=\"https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Teams#Team_Valor\" title=\"Teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Team Valor</a>.</li>\n<li>Yellow Gyms are controlled by <a href=\"https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Teams#Team_Instinct\" title=\"Teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Team Instinct</a>.</li>\n<li>Grey Gyms are neutral and not controlled by any <a href=\"https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Teams\" title=\"Teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Team</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Battling-rival-Gyms\">Battling rival Gyms<a href=\"2019/09/08/What-Do-You-Get-From-Pokemon-Go-Gym?#Battling-rival-Gyms\"></a></h2><p>A Gym controlled by a rival team can be claimed by defeating the Pokémon on the Gym. Each time a rival Pokémon is defeated, its motivation is reduced. When a Pokémon’s motivation reaches zero, it will leave the Gym and return to its Trainer. When all the Pokémon leave the Gym, the Gym becomes open for an opposing team to claim.</p>\n<p>For Gyms with more powerful Pokémon, working with other Trainers is more effective. Gyms can be challenged by multiple Trainers at the same time. Trainers from two teams can even come together to take down a Gym controlled by a third team.</p>\n<p>When battling Pokémon, Pokémon are battled in the order they were assigned to the Gym: the Pokémon on the Gym for the longest time will battle first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Claiming-an-open-Gym\">Claiming an open Gym<a href=\"2019/09/08/What-Do-You-Get-From-Pokemon-Go-Gym?#Claiming-an-open-Gym\"></a></h2><p><a href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemongo/images/1/1e/Open_Gym.png/revision/latest?cb=20170626133917\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemongo/images/1/1e/Open_Gym.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/128?cb=20170626133917\" alt></a> <a href=\"https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/File:Open_Gym.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a></p>\n<p>An open Gym</p>\n<p>Open Gyms are available for Trainers of any team to take.
