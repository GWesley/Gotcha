If you choose to evolve Eevee without any meddling - by feeding it 25 Eevee candy - then it’ll turn to one of the below seven types at random.</p>\n<p>However, players have discovered a trick that allows you to target any of Leafeon, Glaceon, Espeon, Umbreon, Flareon, Jolteon or Vaporeon by using one of the following Eevee names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename Eevee as Linnea to evolve into leaf-type <strong>Leafeon</strong></li>\n<li>Rename Eevee as Rea to evolve into ice-type <strong>Glaceon</strong></li>\n<li>Rename Eevee as Sakura to evolve into psychic-type <strong>Espeon</strong></li>\n<li>Rename Eevee as Tamao to evolve into dark-type <strong>Umbreon</strong></li>\n<li>Rename Eevee as Rainer to evolve into water-type <strong>Vaporeon</strong></li>\n<li>Rename Eevee as Sparky to evolve into lightning-type <strong>Jolteon</strong></li>\n<li>Rename Eevee as Pyro to evolve into fire-type <strong>Flareon</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important note - the trick <strong>only works once</strong> per evolution type, so make sure you choose Eevees with the best <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-30-pokemon-go-cp-meaning-explained-how-to-get-the-highest-cp-values-and-create-the-most-powerful-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CP values</a> before you evolve them into the type you want.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/bq04rh/eevee_name_trick/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McLovin1019 on reddit</a> for confirming the new Leafeon and Glaceon evolution names.</p>\n<p>That said, for select Eevee evolutions, its possible to get the specific types you want through a second method…</p>\n<h2 id=\"Alternate-Eevee-evolution-methods-for-Leafeon-Glaceon-Umbreon-and-Espeon\">Alternate Eevee evolution methods for Leafeon, Glaceon, Umbreon and Espeon<a href=\"2019/09/08/Naming-Tricks-For-Choosing-Your-Eevee-Evolution#Alternate-Eevee-evolution-methods-for-Leafeon-Glaceon-Umbreon-and-Espeon\"></a></h2><p>Gen 4’s <strong>Leafeon and Glaceon have a second Eevee evolution method</strong>, by using the <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-08-pokemon-go-lures-glacial-mossy-magnetic-lure-modules-explained-6002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mossy Lure or Glacial Lure</a> respectively. When you’re in range of that PokéStop with the Lure enabled, go to your Eevee and choose the Evolution.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Gen 2’s <strong>Umbreon and Espeon also have a second Eevee evolution method</strong>. Walk your Eevee as a <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-pokemon-go-buddy-system-distances-rewards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buddy</a> for 10km, then evolve it either during the night (Umbreon) or day (Espeon) and it’ll turn into the desired evolution.</p>\n<p>Note you specifically need to walk 10k and earn two Candies in the process, then keep Eevee as your Buddy when evolving, <em>and</em> be either day or night during the game itself for it to work (thanks to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/96o6nu/psa_the_umbreonespeon_method_is_walk_10k_for_two/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daviebruce72 on reddit</a> for clarifying).</p>\n<p>Since the naming trick only works once per evolution type, this appears to be a useful way to get a second Espeon or Umbreon with some reliability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-you-need-to-know-about-Eevee-Evolution-names-in-Pokemon-Go\">What you need to know about Eevee Evolution names in Pokémon Go<a href=\"2019/09/08/Naming-Tricks-For-Choosing-Your-Eevee-Evolution#What-you-need-to-know-about-Eevee-Evolution-names-in-Pokemon-Go\"></a></h2><p><img src=\"https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2015/articles/1/8/4/4/1/3/8/146884026625.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/quality/75/format/jpg\" alt class=\"article-img\"></p>\n<p>Why Sakura, Tamao, Sparky, Rainer and Pyro?
