Oven:The capacity of a household oven is generally between 30 and 40 liters to meet daily needs. When purchasing, try to choose the model that can be controlled by the upper and lower tubes to facilitate the mastering of the coloring.￼ Kitchen Scale:There are electronic scales and pointer scales. It is recommended to choose an electronic scale with an accuracy of 0.1 gram. It is better if you can also attach the unit conversion function (grams, milliliters) of different materials! Thermometer:Divided into two types: can enter the oven and not. The thermometer that can be used in the oven is to test the actual temperature of the oven. Most of the oven’s indicated temperature and actual furnace temperature are different, sometimes this gap can even reach 30 °C. With a thermometer that can be placed in the oven, you can more accurately grasp the actual furnace temperature and avoid making unfinished or baked products. Most thermometers that are not accessible to the oven are probe-type and can be inserted directly into the liquid to measure temperature. In addition, the infrared thermometer for baking is also available. Just aim at the ingredients and you can know the exact temperature to 0.1 °C. You can choose according to your own needs. Timer:There are also two versions, electronic and mechanical. The electronic version is more precise, but the mechanical version is also sufficient. Set it up as needed. After the time, an alarm will be given to avoid forgetting the ingredients in the oven, causing the heating to be too long, and the dish failed. Eggbeater:Divided into manual and electric.

The silicone material is the first choice because it has a series of advantages such as non-toxic, high temperature resistance and softness.￼ Pastry Bags:There are three kinds of plastic, silicone, special cloth, plastics are mostly used once, some brands can be used after cleaning, the price is lower; silicone and special cloth material can be washed and reused, the price is slightly higher. Oil Paper / Tarpaulin:Oil-paper made of silicone oil and linoleum made of fiberglass are essential for the oven, which prevents the ingredients from sticking to the baking tray and makes cleaning easier. It should be noted that the oil paper is a disposable product, and the tarpaulin can be repeatedly used for repeated use.￼ Insulation Gloves:The oven is nearly 200 ° C high-temperature, a pair of insulated gloves are indispensable, most of the oven will be given insulation gloves when purchased, do not have to buy separately.￼ ￼ Various Cake Molds / Paper Cups:Stainless steel or aluminum cakes, toast molds, silicone cake molds, and disposable small paper cups can be freely selected according to baking needs.

Baking seems complicated, but as long as each process is accurate, you can make a delicious finished product. Precise weighing: Raw material calculations in baking recipes are mostly in grams (g), so be sure to use a precision electronic kitchen scale. When weighing, pay attention to the unit of measurement in the formula, whether it is gram or milliliter (ml). Many kitchen scales are now available for unit switching, or material switching (water, milk, etc.). When weighing the material, place the container on the kitchen scale and then start the power supply to accurately weigh the material.

Do not substitute raw materials:Many green hands who have contacted baking have suffered a lot of failures. One of the important reasons is to replace all kinds of baking ingredients at will: milk is gone, can i change to yogurt? No whipping cream, can i change to milk? And so on. It is important to know that each material has its irreplaceable properties, from density to taste, and the subtle chemical and physical changes that occur during the baking process are lost. Therefore, before testing a recipe, be sure to ensure that every raw material is in place and strictly follow the material and quantity required by the formula to ensure the correct taste of the finished product! Strictly follow the production process:In baking recipes, we often see cumbersome steps: “adding sugar in three times”, “adding eggs one by one”, etc., so that the precise execution process can never be omitted. Adding raw materials at one time will cause irreparable failure. Therefore, please be sure to read each baking recipe carefully, and strictly follow the recipe requirements, and you will surely get the joy of each success.

It is important to know that each material has its irreplaceable properties, from density to taste, and the subtle chemical and physical changes that occur during the baking process are lost. Therefore, before testing a recipe, be sure to ensure that every raw material is in place and strictly follow the material and quantity required by the formula to ensure the correct taste of the finished product! Strictly follow the production process:In baking recipes, we often see cumbersome steps: “adding sugar in three times”, “adding eggs one by one”, etc., so that the precise execution process can never be omitted. Adding raw materials at one time will cause irreparable failure. Therefore, please be sure to read each baking recipe carefully, and strictly follow the recipe requirements, and you will surely get the joy of each success.

Here are the tips for new drivers. Step 1: Park at the pumpCheck your gas tank lid location. Some cars have an arrow on the gas indicator on the dashboard to help you check out on which side of the car your gas tank is. Park your car so that your gas tank lid is facing the nozzle. Step 2: Turn off the engineTurn off the engine. It’s important to turn your car completely off when filling. Find your tank lid button and press it. (general near your brake or footbrake. If you can’t find it, check your manual) Step 3: Pay for and select your gasYou can pay with a credit or debit card at the pump machine by yourself. Just insert the card and set the maximum money you want. You will need to enter your PIN number or the zip code associated with your card. Your card won’t be charged until you’re done pumping the gas and the total amount is determined. You’ll typically have three types of gasoline to choose from: regular (87), mid-grade (89) and premium (91). Regular will usually be just fine unless you have a fancy car. If you are not sure about it, check your manual. (Don’t put diesel in your gasoline vehicles!) Step 4: Pump the gasRemove the fuel nozzle from the pump, remove your fuel cap once you’re ready to insert the nozzle into your tank. Insert the pump nozzle into the fuel filler. Squeeze and hold the “trigger” of the gas nozzle to begin fueling. There usually will be a latch that can lock the trigger in place, so you don’t have to keep squeezing the entire time. If you look at the pump’s screen, you should see a running tab of the cost of your gas, and the amount being dispensed. When the tank is full, the nozzle will automatically shut off. Step 5: Return the gasoline gun and take your receiptCarefully remove the nozzle from your gas tank and place it back in the pump. Put the cap back on the tank, make sure it’s sealed tightly, and close the gas tank door. Then collect your receipt, if you want. Then you are ready to go!","text":"If the fuel in your tank is less than 1/4, you need to pump gas. Here are the tips for new drivers. Step 1: Park at the pumpCheck your gas tank lid location.

How to put on Your ski boots How to control your speedThe Snow Plough or wedge is an invaluable tool for the skier. As a beginner it will allow you to control your speed and stop for the first time. Making a narrower snowplough will let you speed up, and making a wider snowplough will slow you down, and can even bring you to a halt. How to turnTo start a turn all that needs to be done is put your weight on the opposite ski to the direction you want to turn. This makes the ski with more weight on it have more control over your movement than the other ski, and turns your movement more into the direction that that ski wants to travel in. How to stand up after a crash If you have sustained a very bad fall and you are dazed then don’t try to move, shout to call someone over for assistance. Moving could cause more harm ! To stand up, bring your skis closer to your body and keep them parallel. The skis should be at a right angle to the slope; that is, pointing across the slope. Put one hand onto the snow and shift your weight to the skis. Push hard with your legs and stand up, using the poles as support. You’ll feel more at ease if you practice this on a flat surface in advance.","text":"Gliding down a mountain through virgin powder with the sun glistening on surrounding snow covered peaks, all topped with a deep blue, clear sky, has got to be one of the most incredible feelings on earth…Here are a few tips for skiers of all levels to help you enjoy the sensation as much as I do!
