Here are the tips for new drivers. Step 1: Park at the pumpCheck your gas tank lid location. Some cars have an arrow on the gas indicator on the dashboard to help you check out on which side of the car your gas tank is. Park your car so that your gas tank lid is facing the nozzle. Step 2: Turn off the engineTurn off the engine. It’s important to turn your car completely off when filling. Find your tank lid button and press it. (general near your brake or footbrake. If you can’t find it, check your manual) Step 3: Pay for and select your gasYou can pay with a credit or debit card at the pump machine by yourself. Just insert the card and set the maximum money you want. You will need to enter your PIN number or the zip code associated with your card. Your card won’t be charged until you’re done pumping the gas and the total amount is determined. You’ll typically have three types of gasoline to choose from: regular (87), mid-grade (89) and premium (91). Regular will usually be just fine unless you have a fancy car. If you are not sure about it, check your manual. (Don’t put diesel in your gasoline vehicles!) Step 4: Pump the gasRemove the fuel nozzle from the pump, remove your fuel cap once you’re ready to insert the nozzle into your tank. Insert the pump nozzle into the fuel filler. Squeeze and hold the “trigger” of the gas nozzle to begin fueling. There usually will be a latch that can lock the trigger in place, so you don’t have to keep squeezing the entire time. If you look at the pump’s screen, you should see a running tab of the cost of your gas, and the amount being dispensed. When the tank is full, the nozzle will automatically shut off. Step 5: Return the gasoline gun and take your receiptCarefully remove the nozzle from your gas tank and place it back in the pump.

How to put on Your ski boots How to control your speedThe Snow Plough or wedge is an invaluable tool for the skier. As a beginner it will allow you to control your speed and stop for the first time. Making a narrower snowplough will let you speed up, and making a wider snowplough will slow you down, and can even bring you to a halt. How to turnTo start a turn all that needs to be done is put your weight on the opposite ski to the direction you want to turn. This makes the ski with more weight on it have more control over your movement than the other ski, and turns your movement more into the direction that that ski wants to travel in. How to stand up after a crash If you have sustained a very bad fall and you are dazed then don’t try to move, shout to call someone over for assistance. Moving could cause more harm ! To stand up, bring your skis closer to your body and keep them parallel. The skis should be at a right angle to the slope; that is, pointing across the slope. Put one hand onto the snow and shift your weight to the skis. Push hard with your legs and stand up, using the poles as support. You’ll feel more at ease if you practice this on a flat surface in advance.","text":"Gliding down a mountain through virgin powder with the sun glistening on surrounding snow covered peaks, all topped with a deep blue, clear sky, has got to be one of the most incredible feelings on earth…Here are a few tips for skiers of all levels to help you enjoy the sensation as much as I do!
