<p>Much like the main Pokémon games, alongside the standard combat modifiers like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-30-pokemon-go-level-rewards-list-level-up-items-max-level" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Type advantages and weaknesses</a>, it turns out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-21-pokemon-go-players-discover-its-just-as-complex-as-the-main-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon Go has a whole secret layer of stats</a> for every creature in the game, with hidden values for a Pokémon’s Attack, Defence, and Stamina that’s linked to their CP. And like the main Pokémon games, it’s possible to expose these values and maximise them to make your Pokémon as strong as possible.</p>
<p>Stronger, higher CP Pokémon - along with Pokémon that have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-30-pokemon-go-moves-movesets-move-list-and-highest-dps-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most powerful, highest DPS moves</a>, means winning more battles, winning more battles means taking more Gyms, allowing you to get free PokeCoins (and pride) in the process.</p>
<p>So what exactly are all these hidden stats, what do they mean, and how can you use them to get the best, strongest Pokémon in Pokémon Go with the maximum CP possible? Thanks to the work of Pokémon Go community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Silph Road</a>, we know how.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-find-out-approximate-CP-and-IV-values-within-Pokemon-Go-with-the-Appraisal-feature"><a href="#How-to-find-out-approximate-CP-and-IV-values-within-Pokemon-Go-with-the-Appraisal-feature" class="headerlink" title="How to find out approximate CP and IV values within Pokémon Go with the Appraisal feature"></a>How to find out approximate CP and IV values within Pokémon Go with the Appraisal feature</h2><p>Niantic originally released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-08-23-pokemon-go-update-adds-new-appraisal-feature-for-finding-a-monsters-pokepotential" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appraisal feature in 2016</a> in an effort to combat third-party apps. While the feature was useful, the information it gave about a Pokémon’s CP and IV value was rather vague. After three years, however, Niantic has revamped the feature, making it much easier to discover which of your Pokémon are the very best.</p>
<p>To get an Appraisal of your Pokémon, tap the menu in the bottom right corner and select Appraisal when viewing, and then your <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-02-27-pokemon-go-team-change-valor-mystic-instinct-which-to-join-6002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen Team Leader</a> will give you the rundown.</p>
<p>The new Appraisal feature is divided into two stages.</p>
<p>In the first stage, your chosen Team Leader will comment on the size of your Pokémon, telling you how small or how bizarrely big your Pokémon is. This information doesn’t factor into the prowess of battle - so feel free to ignore it.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the Team Leader will tell you when or where you caught the Pokémon (if that information has been recorded), but, more importantly, they’ll show you the Pokémon stats - Attack, Defence and HP.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-07-17-11-42/Pokemon_Go_Max_Stats_Appraise.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/quality/75/format/jpg" alt> A Pokémon with perfect stats.</p>
<p>Each stat has a bar that shows you where it ranks out of 15 on the IV scale. To help communicate this information, the stat bars are divided into three different sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>First section - 1 to 5</li>
<li>Second section - 6 to 10</li>
<li>Third section - 11 to 15</li>
</ul>
<p>The higher the IV stat, the better the Pokémon’s Attack, Defence or HP will be.</p>
<p>If a stat has an IV ranking of 15 - the maximum possible stat - then the bar will be coloured red. On the other hand, if a stat bar is completely empty, then the IV ranking for that stat is 0.</p>
<p>These three stats are then combined into an overall CP and IV ranking for a Pokémon. To give you a quick look at the overall status of your Pokémon, Niantic has created a set of star tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 stars - below 50%</li>
<li>1 star - 51% to 63.4%</li>
<li>2 stars - 66.7% to 80%</li>
<li>3 stars - 82.2% to 98%</li>
<li>3 stars with a red background - 100%</li>
</ul>
<p>The range of star tiers your Pokémon could have.</p>
<p>_Thank you to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/ce6dza/new_appraisal_infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ricktasticdbs</a> from reddit for their help breaking down the new Appraisal system._</p>
<h2 id="How-should-you-use-the-new-Appraisal-feature"><a href="#How-should-you-use-the-new-Appraisal-feature" class="headerlink" title="How should you use the new Appraisal feature?"></a>How should you use the new Appraisal feature?</h2><p>The new Appraisal feature is a great way to quickly discover how powerful your new Pokemon are. Finding out that an old favourite has a three star rating is incredibly gratifying.</p>
<p>It’s especially useful for when you’re comparing a bunch of the same Pokémon, as you can keep the stat appraisal screen open as you move between Pokémon. This allows you to quickly compare stats and star rankings as you try to decide which Pokémon to keep and which ones to release.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.eurogamer.net/img/placeholder.jpg" alt></p>
<p>You can even search for Pokémon by their specific star tier, just like how you can search for them by name. To do this, you’ll need to search:</p>
<ul>
<li>0* = 0 Stars</li>
<li>1* = 1 Star</li>
<li>2* = 2 Stars</li>
<li>3* = 3 Stars</li>
<li>4* = 3 Stars with a red background / 100% Pokémon</li>
</ul>
<p>The new ranking system makes it a lot easier to decide which Pokémon are worth investing your Stardust and Candy in. Though it’s still important to remember a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-10-pokemon-go-rare-pokemon-list-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon’s rarity</a> and whether it’s one of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-01-pokemon-go-best-pokemon-5392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best Pokémon in the game</a>.</p>
<p>Though by and large the closer to 100% this is the better, depending on the Pokémon, some individual stats are more important than others - so it isn’t the be all and end all.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a Snorlax - one of the best creatures to put in a gym with its high health - with a low HP stat, that makes it a less attractive proposition. But then again, because it’s rare, you might not have any alternative Snorlax to rely on. Of course, an average Snorlax will still perform better than others in its field, so it could still be worth Powering up.</p>
<p>Conversely, if it has a low Attack but a high HP and Defence, then that makes the Snorlax well worth investing in.</p>
<p>So, while the new Appraisal feature is going to help you decide which Pokémon to keep, you’re still going to want to know which Pokémon you should be targeting out in the wild. Read on for some more tips on finding Pokémon with the highest CP and IV.</p>
<h2 id="Pokemon-Go-CP-explained-What-is-CP-and-how-is-CP-calculated"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-CP-explained-What-is-CP-and-how-is-CP-calculated" class="headerlink" title="Pokémon Go CP explained: What is CP and how is CP calculated?"></a>Pokémon Go CP explained: What is CP and how is CP calculated?</h2><p>CP, or Combat Points, is a measure of how strong your Pokémon will be in battle against another Pokémon, and is actually a combination of several hidden stats. Each Pokémon in Pokémon Go has a set of Base Stats for Attack, Defence, and Stamina, along with a hidden Level and a hidden modifier for those Base Stats, known as a Pokémon’s IVs.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.eurogamer.net/img/placeholder.jpg" alt>Dragonite’s CP is 3792.</p>
<p>It’s not worth going into too much detail on how all of those stats work (you can read the nitty gritty details over at <a href="http://pokemongo.gamepress.gg/pokemon-stats-advanced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this fan-run wiki</a>) but they can essentially be explained with a nice little analogy about dogs:</p>
<p>Greyhounds, often used for dog racing, are a naturally fast breed of dog. Bulldogs, not so fast. Just like Greyhounds are naturally speedy, Dragonites, as a Pokémon species, have naturally high Attack - or, in other words, a naturally high Base Stat for Attack - contrast that with Machokes which, despite having decent Attack, are somewhat puny by comparison.</p>
<p>However, every now and then you might get a Greyhound that is so slow, and a Bulldog that is so fast, that out of these two individual dogs the Bulldog is actually faster.</p>
<p>So, in Pokémon Go, you might get such a naturally low-Attack Dragonite, and naturally high-Attack Machoke, that you’ll hit the point where the Machoke actually has a higher overall Attack than the Dragonite. That’s because the Individual Values of the Machoke - basically its genes - are considerably stronger than those of the Dragonite.</p>
<p>In Pokémon Go, IVs are given a value out of 15 for each stat, so a spread of 15/15/15 across Attack, Defence, and Stamina would be considered perfect IVs.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.eurogamer.net/img/placeholder.jpg" alt>The curved white bar indicates how far you’ve levelled up your Pokémon.</p>
<p>Finally, you have the Pokémon Level. In brief, a Pokémon Level is like how hard the Pokémon has been training, so again, a more well-trained Machoke with a higher Level might have an overall higher Attack than an untrained Dragonite.</p>
<p>Raising a Pokémon’s Level is easy enough - each time you use the Power Up function in-game, it raises that Pokémon by half a level. Note that the Level always caps out at a maximum of 1.5 Levels above your own Trainer Level, but that maximum does still increase alongside your Trainer Level over time.</p>
<p>You can get a rough estimate of a Pokémon’s Level from the white curved bar above its head - a bar all the way to the right means the Pokémon is at its current maximum Level, and a bar all the way to the left means it’s at its minimum Level, which is always Level 1.</p>
<p>So, a combination of a Pokémon’s hidden Base Stats, IVs, and Level are what dictate its CP - the higher the better, but remember that just because that Drowzee you caught has higher CP than your old one, that doesn’t <em>necessarily</em> mean it’s stronger. It might just be a higher Level.</p>

Here’s how you do it, step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick your Pokémon from our ranked list of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-30-pokemon-go-best-pokemon-highest-hp-attack-defence-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the strongest Pokémon in Pokémon Go</a>.</li>
<li>Go and catch it!

</ol>
<ul>

</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Once you have your Pokémon of choice - let’s say a Dratini - you then need to figure out whether it’s any good. To do that, you’ll need to find its Level and IVs, which are invisible in-game. But worry not! The community have put together a variety of IV calculators, which give you a percentage estimate for how good your Dratini’s IVs are. Our recommendation is the Silph Road, a community site with <a href="https://thesilphroad.com/iv-rater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its own IV calculator</a>.</li>
<li>A perfect 15/15/15 set of IVs will come out as 4* in search or 100% in a calculator, so once you’ve found a Dratini which comes out as perfect - or one which is close enough to perfect for you to be happy - then it’s time to evolve it.</li>
<li>You can check out our tips for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-30-pokemon-go-how-to-evolve-special-items-when-to-evolve-or-power-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolving Pokémon in Pokémon Go</a> for more detail, but generally it’s advisable to evolve your high-IV Pokémon before you start spending Stardust to Power Up and increase its Level. That’s because each time a Pokémon evolves, although its IVs stay the same, its moveset is randomised. So you might end up with that genetically perfect Dragonite, only for it to have a rubbish set of moves that spoil all your hard work finding it.</li>
<li>Finally, once you’re happy with your perfect IV Dragonite, with the perfect moveset (check our guide to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-30-pokemon-go-moves-movesets-move-list-and-highest-dps-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon Go moves and movesets</a> for more on that!), it’s time to Power Up your Pokémon to the maximum level. So go find more Dratini, grind them down into Dratini Candies and feed them to your Dragonite. Don’t forget that your Pokémon’s maximum Level increases alongside your own Trainer Level, so your Pokémon won’t be the very best it can be until you yourself hit the cap at Level 40.</li>

<p>There’s been another update to the list of Pokemon Go shadow Pokemon, as Team Rocket has corrupted even more pocket monsters. Shadow Pokemon like Oddish, Larvitar, and Turtwig can now be caught when taking down a Team Rocket pokestop, enticing more players to tackle them in the hopes of catching more shadow Pokemon in <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/pokemon-go-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon Go</a>. Much like the Pokemon on the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/pokemon-go-shiny-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon Go shiny list</a>, collecting all of the Pokemon Go shadow Pokemon is a lofty goal for trainers around the world and with the latest additions, it’s become even more difficult.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-Pokemon-Go-shadow-Pokemon"><a href="#What-are-Pokemon-Go-shadow-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="What are Pokemon Go shadow Pokemon?"></a>What are Pokemon Go shadow Pokemon?</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fKMCcqsMqTgN3otPWF9ze-320-80.jpg" alt></p>
<p>Shadow Pokemon in Pokemon Go are some Pokemon that Team Rocket have brought with them. Whenever you defeat a Team Rocket GO Grunt at a pokestop they’ve taken over, you’ll have the opportunity to catch a shadow Pokemon that they’ve left behind. They’re easily distinguishable due to the purple aura around them, red eyes, and when you catch them, you’ll notice that their CP is significantly lower than you’d expect.</p>

<p>There is a slim chance of getting a shiny Pokemon by simply going out and encountering Pokemon in the wild. Just keep going into the capture phase to find out if the Pokemon you’ve encountered is a shiny!</p>
<h4 id="Participate-In-Community-Day"><a href="#Participate-In-Community-Day" class="headerlink" title="Participate In Community Day"></a>Participate In Community Day</h4><p><img src="https://gamewith-en.akamaized.net/img/20c9dfd6d6673b3976a0567bbe587630.jpg" alt></p>
<p>Community Days in Pokemon GO feature a specific Pokemon and normally increase the rates of their shiny spawns. Participate in Community Days to increase your chances of getting a shiny of the featured Pokemon!</p>

<p>Shiny Pokemon are the same as their regular versions with a different color scheme. You can sometimes find Shiny Pokemon on your map. They look like their normal counterparts, but turn shiny when you try to capture them.</p>
<h3 id="Rare-Spawn-That-Don’t-Appear-Often"><a href="#Rare-Spawn-That-Don’t-Appear-Often" class="headerlink" title="Rare Spawn That Don’t Appear Often"></a>Rare Spawn That Don’t Appear Often</h3><p>Shinies don’t appear in the wild often and are considered rare spawn. You actually have to encounter a Pokemon and enter the capture phase before you’ll find out they’re a shiny.</p>

<h2 id="Details"><a href="#Details" class="headerlink" title="Details"></a>Details</h2><p>A Pokémon’s ability to be successful in battle is primarily influenced by its <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon#Hit_Points" title="Pokémon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hit Points</a> (HP) and <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_Power" title="Combat Power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Combat Power</a> (CP).</p>
<p>Every Pokémon on a Gym has Motivation, a measurement of the Pokémon’s desire to defend the location. Trainers from opposing teams battle to reduce the motivation of the Pokémon on the Gym. Pokémon gradually lose motivation over time and by losing battles against opposing team members. As a Pokémon loses motivation, its CP will temporarily decrease, making it weaker in battle. When a Pokémon’s motivation reaches zero, it leaves the Gym and returns to its Trainer.</p>
<p>For Gyms controlled by a team, their goal is to keep motivation up by giving the Pokémon treats. For Gyms controlled by opposing teams, their goal is to gain control of the Gym by depleting the motivation of opposing team’s Pokémon. Each trainers can leave only one Pokémon to defend each of their Gyms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue Gyms are controlled by <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Teams#Team_Mystic" title="Teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Mystic</a>.</li>

<h2 id="Battling-rival-Gyms"><a href="#Battling-rival-Gyms" class="headerlink" title="Battling rival Gyms"></a>Battling rival Gyms</h2><p>A Gym controlled by a rival team can be claimed by defeating the Pokémon on the Gym. Each time a rival Pokémon is defeated, its motivation is reduced. When a Pokémon’s motivation reaches zero, it will leave the Gym and return to its Trainer. When all the Pokémon leave the Gym, the Gym becomes open for an opposing team to claim.</p>
<p>For Gyms with more powerful Pokémon, working with other Trainers is more effective. Gyms can be challenged by multiple Trainers at the same time. Trainers from two teams can even come together to take down a Gym controlled by a third team.</p>
<p>When battling Pokémon, Pokémon are battled in the order they were assigned to the Gym: the Pokémon on the Gym for the longest time will battle first.</p>

<p>An open Gym</p>
<p>Open Gyms are available for Trainers of any team to take. Teams are able to assign up to 6 Pokémon to a Gym, but a single Trainer can only assign one Pokémon to the Gym. Only one Pokémon of a single species can be assigned to a Gym at one time. So if there’s a <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Pikachu" title="Pikachu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pikachu</a> assigned to a Gym, another Trainer may not place their Pikachu in the Gym.You cannot assign a legendary Pokémon to a gym.</p>

<p>Motivation meter</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong> is a measurement of the <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon" title="Pokémon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon’s</a> desire to defend the location and every Pokémon on a Gym has a motivation meter to represent this value.</p>
<p>Pokémon assigned to defend a Gym lose motivation over time and as they are defeated in battle. As a Pokémon loses motivation, its CP will temporarily decrease, making it easier for opposing teams to defeat. To help keep the Pokémon motivated and in tip-top shape for their next battle, <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Trainers" title="Trainers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trainers</a> can treat their <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Team" title="Team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team’s</a> Pokémon to some berries, which restore their motivation. If a Pokémon loses all motivation, it will leave the Gym and return to its Trainer the next time it loses a battle, so Trainers will want to keep their team’s Pokémon motivated by giving them Berries frequently.</p>

Increasing the Pokémon’s motivation makes it harder for rival teams to capture the location.</p>
<p>Berries can be given to any Pokémon on Gyms controlled by a Trainer’s team. Any kind of Berry can be given to a Pokémon - <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Berries#Golden_Razz_Berry" title="Berries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golden Razz Berries</a>, <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Razz_Berries" title="Razz Berries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razz Berries</a>, <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Nanab_Berries" title="Nanab Berries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nanab Berries</a>, and <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Pinap_Berries" title="Pinap Berries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinap Berries</a>. All Berries provide the same increase in motivation, with the exception of the Golden Razz Berry, which fully restores motivation; and the Nanab Berry, which increases the motivation by an additional 150%. In addition to keeping the defending Pokémon happy and strong for battle, <a href="https://pokemongo.fandom.com/wiki/Stardust" title="Stardust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stardust</a> and XP can be earned for giving Berries to Pokémon defending Gyms. A Trainer may feed up to ten berries per Pokémon before they are subjected to a cooldown.</p>

<p>The longer the Pokémon stay on the Gym, the more PokéCoins will be earned.

Trainers should give Pokémon treats often to keep them on the Gym and maximize the PokéCoins they’ll earn. When a Pokémon leaves the Gym, it will return to its Trainer’s collection bringing PokéCoins with it. A notification will be received with the amount of PokéCoins earned when the Pokémon returns to its Trainer. To get 50 PokéCoins within a day with one defender, it has to be in the Gym for 8 hour and 20 minutes.</p>
<p>PokéCoins are only redeemed after the Pokémon returns from the Gym.

</blockquote>
<p><strong>How to evolve Eevee</strong> continues to be one of the bigger talking points in Pokémon Go.</p>
<p>In the classic Pokémon games, <strong>Eevee can evolve</strong> into different typing varieties - known as <strong>Eeveelutions</strong> by names - based on the use of special items, its happiness level, moves it has available and even the time of day.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-10-pokemon-go-how-to-get-candy-rare-candy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Candy in Pokémon Go</a>, the way you evolve Pokémon is much simpler, and as such, you cannot use the tried-and-tested method of using one of three elemental stones to <strong>turn Eevee into Flareon, Jolteon and Vaporeon</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you have caught enough Eevees to evolve one - our pages on finding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-02-10-pokemon-go-locations-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon by location</a>, finding which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-23-pokemon-go-eggs-chart-hatching-2km-5km-10km-eggs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon hatch from which eggs</a> and locating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-02-10-pokemon-go-nests-london-uk-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon nests</a> near you can help - a neat trick will get you the evolution you need by using a special <strong>Eevee name</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s how Eevee evolutions work. If you choose to evolve Eevee without any meddling - by feeding it 25 Eevee candy - then it’ll turn to one of the below seven types at random.</p>
<p>However, players have discovered a trick that allows you to target any of Leafeon, Glaceon, Espeon, Umbreon, Flareon, Jolteon or Vaporeon by using one of the following Eevee names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename Eevee as Linnea to evolve into leaf-type <strong>Leafeon</strong></li>
<li>Rename Eevee as Rea to evolve into ice-type <strong>Glaceon</strong></li>
<li>Rename Eevee as Sakura to evolve into psychic-type <strong>Espeon</strong></li>
<li>Rename Eevee as Tamao to evolve into dark-type <strong>Umbreon</strong></li>
<li>Rename Eevee as Rainer to evolve into water-type <strong>Vaporeon</strong></li>
<li>Rename Eevee as Sparky to evolve into lightning-type <strong>Jolteon</strong></li>
<li>Rename Eevee as Pyro to evolve into fire-type <strong>Flareon</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Important note - the trick <strong>only works once</strong> per evolution type, so make sure you choose Eevees with the best <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-30-pokemon-go-cp-meaning-explained-how-to-get-the-highest-cp-values-and-create-the-most-powerful-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CP values</a> before you evolve them into the type you want.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/bq04rh/eevee_name_trick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McLovin1019 on reddit</a> for confirming the new Leafeon and Glaceon evolution names.</p>
<p>That said, for select Eevee evolutions, its possible to get the specific types you want through a second method…</p>
<h2 id="Alternate-Eevee-evolution-methods-for-Leafeon-Glaceon-Umbreon-and-Espeon"><a href="#Alternate-Eevee-evolution-methods-for-Leafeon-Glaceon-Umbreon-and-Espeon" class="headerlink" title="Alternate Eevee evolution methods for Leafeon, Glaceon, Umbreon and Espeon"></a>Alternate Eevee evolution methods for Leafeon, Glaceon, Umbreon and Espeon</h2><p>Gen 4’s <strong>Leafeon and Glaceon have a second Eevee evolution method</strong>, by using the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-08-pokemon-go-lures-glacial-mossy-magnetic-lure-modules-explained-6002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mossy Lure or Glacial Lure</a> respectively. When you’re in range of that PokéStop with the Lure enabled, go to your Eevee and choose the Evolution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gen 2’s <strong>Umbreon and Espeon also have a second Eevee evolution method</strong>. Walk your Eevee as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-pokemon-go-buddy-system-distances-rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddy</a> for 10km, then evolve it either during the night (Umbreon) or day (Espeon) and it’ll turn into the desired evolution.</p>
<p>Note you specifically need to walk 10k and earn two Candies in the process, then keep Eevee as your Buddy when evolving, <em>and</em> be either day or night during the game itself for it to work (thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/96o6nu/psa_the_umbreonespeon_method_is_walk_10k_for_two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daviebruce72 on reddit</a> for clarifying).</p>
<p>Since the naming trick only works once per evolution type, this appears to be a useful way to get a second Espeon or Umbreon with some reliability.</p>

<p>Why Sakura, Tamao, Sparky, Rainer and Pyro? The original three are the names of the Eevee brothers from the Pokémon television show, who meet with Ash and the gang in episode 40 to show off their respective Eevee evolutions, with Sakura and Tamao appearing later on in the series.</p>
<p>Once you have called your Eevee into one of the above names, you should quit and reload the app to double check the name change has taken place, which is important considering the servers can lean to be on the unreliable side.</p>
<p>Once you’ve double checked the new name is indeed in place, then evolve the Eevee as you would any other Pokémon by feeding it Candy, and it should take the form of your chosen type.</p>

<p>If you want to get your hands on the final Eevee evolution in Pokémon Go, then you’re out of luck - you can’t just yet.</p>
<p>So far, Pokémon Go has added Eevee evolutions for the first four Generations of creatures, which means Eevee can only evolve into Leafeon, Glaceon, Umbreon, Espeon, Flareon, Jolteon and Vaporeon for now.</p>
<p>That leaves just Sylveon to go. Since it’s from Gen 6, it’ll be a good while yet, but you can be sure there’ll be a Eevee evolution name to go with it.</p>

<p>Ditto is a Pokémon who can transform — essentially take on the appearance and attributes of other Pokémon. Although missing from the original release of <a href="https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon Go</a> Gen 1, Ditto eventually found its way out into the world, hiding as Pidgy, Ratatta, Zubat, and Magikarp. With Gen 2, Ditto also learned to hide as Sentra, Yanma, and Hoothoot, and Gen 3, as Zigzagoon and Taillow. Then, when Shiny Magikarp appeared, Ditto Magikarp disappeared. Now, just as Ditto has become a prerequisite for finding the mythical Mew, Ditto has added Whismur, Gulpin, Paras, and Remoraid to its repertoire as well, and now Meltan as well.</p>
<p>So, come out, come out, wherever you are. It’s time to play hunt and go catch!</p>
<h2 id="Which-Pokemon-can-be-Ditto"><a href="#Which-Pokemon-can-be-Ditto" class="headerlink" title="Which Pokémon can be Ditto?"></a>Which Pokémon can be Ditto?</h2><p>As of August 2019:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paras</li>
<li>Sentret</li>
<li>Yanma</li>
<li>Hoothoot</li>
<li>Whismur</li>
<li>Gulpin</li>
<li>Remoraid</li>
<li>Ledyba</li>
<li>Venonat</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="February-28-2019-Ditto-can-now-be-Venonat-or-Ledyba-can-no-longer-be-Pidgey-or-Ratatta"><a href="#February-28-2019-Ditto-can-now-be-Venonat-or-Ledyba-can-no-longer-be-Pidgey-or-Ratatta" class="headerlink" title="February 28, 2019: Ditto can now be Venonat or Ledyba, can no longer be Pidgey or Ratatta"></a>February 28, 2019: Ditto can now be Venonat or Ledyba, can no longer be Pidgey or Ratatta</h2><p>Thanks to the arrival of Shiny Pidget and Ratatta, which means they can no longer be Ditto in disguised — because anyone catching a Shiny only to see it turn into a non-Shiny Ditto would be super sad/mad — Pokémon Go has swapped them out for Venonaut and Ledyba.</p>
<p>So, make sure you keep checking Pidget and Ratatta for the chance at a Shiny but now also check Ledyba and Venonat for a chance at a Ditto.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-Ditto-and-why-do-you-want-it"><a href="#What’s-Ditto-and-why-do-you-want-it" class="headerlink" title="What’s Ditto and why do you want it?"></a>What’s Ditto and why do you want it?</h2><p>Ditto is one of the first generation Pokémon that wasn’t available at the launch of Pokémon Go game. It took a while for that to change. You want Ditto because the hiding mechanic isn’t just cool, you need it to complete your Pokédex. Here’s the official announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Willow has finally discovered Ditto! Trainers all over the world have been reporting its appearance.</p>
<p>Ditto has been known to disguise itself as other Pokémon, so keep an eye out, some Pokémon may actually be Ditto, and when you capture them, there’s a chance that Ditto will reveal itself. If you do encounter a Pokémon that is Ditto in disguise, the Pokémon in that specific encounter will also reveal itself as Ditto for other Trainers.</p>
<p>Ditto is also a unique Pokémon when you interact with Gyms. When training or battling at a Gym, Ditto will copy the appearance, types, and moves of the first Pokémon it sees, and it will stay that way through the remainder of those Gym battles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="And-now-you-also-need-Ditto-to-find-Mew"><a href="#And-now-you-also-need-Ditto-to-find-Mew" class="headerlink" title="And now you also need Ditto to find Mew?"></a>And now you also need Ditto to find Mew?</h2><p>Yes, as part of the spring 2018 research update, Pokémon Go added a Mythical Discovery quest. One of the tasks of the 5th part is catching a Ditto. You need do that before you can advance on and find — and try to catch — Mew.</p>
<h2 id="So-Ditto-hides-as-other-Pokemon"><a href="#So-Ditto-hides-as-other-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="So Ditto hides as other Pokémon?"></a>So Ditto hides as other Pokémon?</h2><p>Yup! Ditto can transform into other Pokémon and, so far, he’s only being encountered in the wild in his transformed state. That means you can’t see Ditto on <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-track-and-find-nearby-pokemon-in-pokemon-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearby or Sightings</a>, and you won’t know if he’s spawned right next to you until you catch him.</p>
<p>It’s only then you’ll be greeted with an “Oh?” instead of a “Gotcha!” and he’ll be revealed as Ditto. So, you gotta catch’em all. Literally. Because any one of them could be Ditto.</p>
<p>In terms of game mechanics, how that seems to work is anytime you catch what could be a Ditto in disguise, the Pokémon Go servers randomly determine if it’s secretly a Ditto or not.</p>
<p>So, until it’s caught, it’s not a Ditto and can’t be detected as a Ditto at all. Once it’s caught and is determined to be a Ditto, anyone who catches the same Pokémon will also have it revealed to be a Ditto.</p>
<p>Schrodinger’s Pokemon, do be sure!</p>
<h2 id="Which-Gen-1-Pokemon-can-be-Ditto-in-disguise"><a href="#Which-Gen-1-Pokemon-can-be-Ditto-in-disguise" class="headerlink" title="Which Gen 1 Pokémon can be Ditto in disguise?"></a>Which Gen 1 Pokémon can be Ditto in disguise?</h2><p>Ditto hides as a base-level, very common Pokémon. In Gen 1, that includes:</p>
<p>1, Venonat 1. Paras</p>
<h2 id="Wait-no-more-Ditton-hiding-as-Magikarp-Pidget-or-Rattata"><a href="#Wait-no-more-Ditton-hiding-as-Magikarp-Pidget-or-Rattata" class="headerlink" title="Wait, no more Ditton hiding as Magikarp, Pidget, or Rattata?"></a>Wait, no more Ditton hiding as Magikarp, Pidget, or Rattata?</h2><p>No, not since Shiny Magikarp came out and the reaction to losing a Shiny Karp to a non-Shiny Ditto was… extreme. Pokémon Go fixed it in days by telling Ditto it could no longer hide in Magikarp. The same has now happened to Pidget and Rattata thanks to their Shiny versions becoming available.</p>
<h2 id="Which-Gen-2-Pokemon-can-be-Ditto-in-disguise"><a href="#Which-Gen-2-Pokemon-can-be-Ditto-in-disguise" class="headerlink" title="Which Gen 2 Pokémon can be Ditto in disguise?"></a>Which Gen 2 Pokémon can be Ditto in disguise?</h2><p><img src="https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/larger/public/field/image/2017/03/pokemon-go-ditto-gen-2-screens.jpg?itok=hv5_SrBc" alt></p>
<p>Gen 2 only has four Ditto candidates so far, and one of them is typically far less common than all the others:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hoothoot</li>
<li>Sentret</li>
<li>Yanma</li>
<li>Ledyba</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Which-Gen-3-Pokemon-can-be-Ditto-in-disguise"><a href="#Which-Gen-3-Pokemon-can-be-Ditto-in-disguise" class="headerlink" title="Which Gen 3 Pokémon can be Ditto in disguise?"></a>Which Gen 3 Pokémon can be Ditto in disguise?</h2><ol>
<li>Whismur</li>
<li>Gulpin</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Ugh-so-you-really-have-to-catch-a-bunch-of-commons"><a href="#Ugh-so-you-really-have-to-catch-a-bunch-of-commons" class="headerlink" title="Ugh, so you really have to catch a bunch of commons?"></a>Ugh, so you really have to catch a bunch of commons?</h2><p>Yeah, but remember, you can use many of them to grind out XP so even if they aren’t Ditto. So, it’s not time/effort completely wasted.</p>
<h2 id="Is-there-any-way-to-speed-up-the-Ditto-catching-process"><a href="#Is-there-any-way-to-speed-up-the-Ditto-catching-process" class="headerlink" title="Is there any way to speed up the Ditto catching process?"></a>Is there any way to speed up the Ditto catching process?</h2><p>Yes. Crowd-source it. If you’re already part of a local Pokémon Go community on Discord, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Slack, or a similar service, for example, for organizing Raids, ask everyone to post their Ditto encounters so you can try to get to one live. You may want to make a separate group or room for Ditto hunting so you don’t spam players who already have Ditto, but as long as it’s local, it should increase your chances.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-I-catch-Ditto-when-I-find-it"><a href="#How-do-I-catch-Ditto-when-I-find-it" class="headerlink" title="How do I catch Ditto when I find it?"></a>How do I catch Ditto when I find it?</h2><p>Since Ditto hides as common Pokémon, you catch it in the same way. Some common Pokémon are harder to catch than you’d expect — thanks, Pokémon Go! — especially if they’re low stat (IV) and high level. That’s where the CP looks low but they’re a huge pain to catch. Ditto tends to fall into that category as well.</p>
<p>The usual rules apply, though. Always go for curveballs, and stack as many bonuses as you can and have at them!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imore.com/how-to-catch-rare-pokemon-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to stack bonuses to catch tough Pokémon in Pokémon Go!</a></p>
<h2 id="Where-can-I-catch-Ditto"><a href="#Where-can-I-catch-Ditto" class="headerlink" title="Where can I catch Ditto?"></a>Where can I catch Ditto?</h2><p>Ditto doesn’t have nests or spawn points, per se, but the Pokémon that could be Ditto in disguise certainly do.</p>
<p>Some areas, including PokéStops, Gyms, parking lots, malls, etc. have spawn points where multiple Pokémon appear at once and most of them are the really common kind. That’s perfect for Ditto.</p>
<p>I caught my first Ditto in the parking lot of a McDonald’s. I’ve caught others at spawn points on street corners and food courts.</p>
<p>If you see two Rattata or a couple of Pidgey, you can catch them all and play the odds on getting a Ditto.</p>
<h2 id="Can-I-get-Ditto-with-Incense-and-Lures"><a href="#Can-I-get-Ditto-with-Incense-and-Lures" class="headerlink" title="Can I get Ditto with Incense and Lures?"></a>Can I get Ditto with Incense and Lures?</h2><p>The second Ditto I caught was from Incense, and so were the next four or so as well. Lures also work. That means you can drop one or the other and, instead of focusing on a rare, focus on the four to six commons that appear. Catch those and hope for the best.</p>
<p>So, if you have a favorite route or favorite place to hang, drop some Incense or a Lure and, fingers crossed, let Ditto come to you.</p>
<h2 id="Is-Ditto-random-or-can-everyone-catch-him"><a href="#Is-Ditto-random-or-can-everyone-catch-him" class="headerlink" title="Is Ditto random or can everyone catch him?"></a>Is Ditto random or can everyone catch him?</h2><p>If you catch a Gulpin and it turns out to be Ditto, anyone else who catches that Gulpin will also see it transform into Ditto. In other words, once a Pokémon is revealed as Ditto, it’s consistently Ditto for everyone.</p>
<p>So, if you’re playing as a family or are out in a group and one of you catches Ditto, let everyone else know and you’ll all get Ditto. Dividing and conquering is a great way to churn through a lot of low-level spawns at once as well.</p>
<h2 id="Can-I-catch-Ditto-with-the-Pokemon-Go-Plus"><a href="#Can-I-catch-Ditto-with-the-Pokemon-Go-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Can I catch Ditto with the Pokémon Go Plus?"></a>Can I catch Ditto with the Pokémon Go Plus?</h2><p>Yes, absolutely! It’ll try to catch Ditto just like it would the Pokémon Ditto’s pretending to be. Catch that Pokémon and you’ve caught Ditto. But remember, Pokémon Go Plus only throws normal Poké Balls, so there’s also a chance the Pokémon will run and you’ll never know whether or not it was a Ditto.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-Ditto-work-in-Gyms-and-Raids"><a href="#How-does-Ditto-work-in-Gyms-and-Raids" class="headerlink" title="How does Ditto work in Gyms and Raids?"></a>How does Ditto work in Gyms and Raids?</h2><p><img src="https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/larger/public/field/image/2016/11/ditto-transform.gif?itok=fYjWMkoV" alt></p>
<p>Ditto only has one moveset: Transform and Struggle. Transform does zero damage but, instead, immediately changes Ditto in the same Pokémon he’s fighting. That’s true whether he’s defending a Gym or attacking it, for training or for taking down.</p>
<p>He also takes on the attributes of the Pokémon he’s mimicking, though there are some reports that his exact CP will vary based on his level rather than the level of the Pokémon he’s copying. And, of course, a Ditto transforming into another Ditto stays the same.</p>

<p>In the world of Pokémon GO, every ounce of XP matters, whether it’s from getting that bonus 100 XP you gain from your 100th Pokémon, all the way to the 50 XP you gain from turning a Poke Stop. But do Nice, Great, Excellent and Curve Ball really matter?</p>
<p>I am usually a guy who uses Great Throw, and in no way an expert at this art form of throwing, but I do spend awfully a lot of time in with some of the best “Excellent throwers”. Not sure if they’re really the best, but when you spend in excess of 100 hours playing the same game with the same people, cognitive bias tends to happen. Even further, the community I play with, holds an playing <strong>Excellent Throw competition</strong> <strong>on a nightly basis.</strong></p>
<p>The winner of the competition is usually the first person to 10 Excellent Throws (we shout out at 5 and 7 throws). Occasionally teams are formed and the true game then begins. I myself have entered into these competitions, but to no avail: not because I suck but because these guys I play with are so good.</p>
<p>So, I did a bit of math and right from the outset you can immediately see that gaining a catch with a Curve ball and Excellent Throw gives you an additional 110 XP. That’s an incredible 110% of bonus XP per catch. It may not seem like a lot, but in an hour grind session when you put on a Lucky Egg, you’re running into some serious power leveling XP.</p>
<p>Here’s the guide to getting curve ball excellent throws (almost) every time.</p>
<h2 id="Your-Phone-Matters"><a href="#Your-Phone-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone Matters"></a>Your Phone Matters</h2><p>I play Pokemon Go using the Huawei P8 Lite and I’ve gotten used to the lag. Every time I switch it for my friend’s Galaxy S7 Edge which has no lag seize, it’s way easier to throw. Although I’ve adapted to my phones lag I know that playing with a phone that has quicker response time and no lag makes the difference between getting an Excellent or a Nice throw on many occasions.</p>
<p>Conclusion? <strong>Having a good phone matters.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PvT09yk.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PvT09yk.png" alt></a></p>
<h2 id="Go-for-the-Bulls-Eye"><a href="#Go-for-the-Bulls-Eye" class="headerlink" title="Go for the Bulls Eye"></a>Go for the Bulls Eye</h2><p>The Bulls eye is something you’ll start to see the more you play and the more Excellent Throws you get. This technique requires you to follow the size of the circle on the Pokémon that is getting smaller:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make that same size circle (with your finger) as the one on the Pokémon you’re targeting</li>
<li>as it gets smaller so does the one your drawing until you see your bulls eye (Excellent Throw circle)</li>
<li>adjust your angle so it curves in and throw.</li>
</ul>
<p>This technique was suggested loads of time by people that are crazy good at excellent throws and is the foundation of how i found my style of throw.</p>
<h2 id="Figure-out-your-style"><a href="#Figure-out-your-style" class="headerlink" title="Figure out your style"></a>Figure out your style</h2><p>Find your style. We are created differently so why would we all throw the same way. I’ve seen people hit Excellent Throws using their pinky finger, the ring finger, <strong>their nose</strong> and even without looking. Starting from the right side, the left side, spinning clockwise, spinning anti clockwise, find your style. <strong>Find your style.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Join-Excellent-Throw-Competitions"><a href="#Join-Excellent-Throw-Competitions" class="headerlink" title="Join Excellent Throw Competitions"></a>Join Excellent Throw Competitions</h2><p>One of the things that has helped improve my Excellent throws is the introduction of the Excellent Throw competitions within our Pogo Community. <strong>The First person to hit a set amount of Excellent Throws wins.</strong> Excellent with no curve is half a point and Excellent with Curve on a Weddle is 2 points.</p>
<p>A bit competition, pressure and focus goes a long way to improving that Excellent regardless of the outcome of the competition.</p>
<h2 id="Practice"><a href="#Practice" class="headerlink" title="Practice"></a>Practice</h2><p>The most obvious tip is to practice, a lot. This isn’t the lazy thumb flick and yup I’ve practiced heaps. This is focusing and practicing on hitting that small circle and keeping at it until it eventually becomes that lazy thumb flick by default.</p>
<p>I asked around among my POGO community to see what the longest streak of consecutive excellent throws and the response was insane 6, 9 and then a whopping 11. These trainers had mastered the excellent throw and once it made sense to them, they managed to level up fast. Their levels are 40, 40 and 38.</p>
<p>At the end of the day I’m content with Great Throws (and so should you be), but hitting those Excellent Throws every time should be the dream. For now, I don’t mind trying every time, at least I get a Great throw if I miss an Excellent.</p>
