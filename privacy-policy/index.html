This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through our websites from which you are accessing this policy, including lalawe.com (the “Websites”), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the “Apps”), as well as through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Websites and Apps, the “Services”).</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information about an identified or identifiable individual, excluding business contact information.</p>
<p>By providing Personal Information, or other information, to us or using our Services, you confirm that you understand and consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and processing of your Personal Information and other information (or the Personal Information or other information of any other individual you provide) in the manner as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you understand that this Privacy Policy is legally binding when you use our Services. Check the Customer Agreement for the meaning of defined words (those with capital letters) that are not defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Information we may collect about you<br>We collect your Personal Information and other information when you provide it to us, when you use the Services and when you register for the Services (e.g., a lalawe Account). We may collect the following Personal Information from you: your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, financial information (including credit card, debit card, bank account information or bank account login credentials), occupation, personal description and photograph.</p>
<p>We must by law confirm your identity in order to provide certain Services to you e.g., if you send or receive certain high-value or high volume transactions, or as needed to comply with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to our anti-money laundering obligations. In order to meet our compliance requirements, we may need to collect valid identification documents, such as a copy of your driver’s license, passport or similar identity document, and/or additional commercial and/or financial information from you as required. If you submit Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you warrant that you have obtained the necessary consents from such individual and have authority to disclose his/her Personal Information to us, as well as his/her consent to our collection, use and disclosure of such personal data, for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Technical Information we collect:</p>
<p>details of you carry out on our Website or when using our Services, including geographic location from which the transaction originates;<br>technical information, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform;<br>information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through or from our Website (including date and time); products you viewed or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page and any phone number used to call our Customer Support number.<br>We may aggregate Personal Information.<br>Such aggregated information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services.

<p>Information we receive from other sources.<br>We may receive information about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide.

The social media network will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to them, including your name, profile image and e-mail address. We use such information, together with any other information you directly provide to us when registering or using our Services, to create your account and to communicate with you about the information, products and services that you request from us.

We will use, disclose and store all of this information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technologies.<br>Our Website uses cookies, some of which may collect your Personal Information or Technical Information, to distinguish you from other users of our Website.

<p>How do we protect your Personal Information<br>Your Personal Information is protected by security safeguards appropriate to the level of sensitivity of the information through (i) physical measures, such as secure areas; (ii) technical measures, such as encryption and secure servers; and (iii) organizational measures, such as due diligence in transferring Personal Information to third-party processors.

If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contact” section below. For more information about security, please see the Account Security and Privacy and Information Security sections of the Customer Agreement.</p>
<p>Cross-Border Transfer.<br>We may transfer your Personal Information to a third-party service provider for processing and storage. Whenever we engage a third-party service provider, we ensure that the information is properly safeguarded at all times at a comparable level of protection the information would have received if it had not been transferred.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Services you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of Canada, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules. In the event that your Personal Information is transferred outside of Canada, the government, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of that jurisdiction may be able to obtain disclosure of your Personal Information through the laws of that jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Third Party Services<br>Our Services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers, affiliates, and others. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that we are not responsible for the privacy, these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility for them. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
<p>In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Apps.</p>
<p>Use of Services by Minors<br>The Services are not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we request that they not provide Personal Information through the Services.</p>
<p>Changes to our Privacy Policy<br>We may change this Privacy Policy. The “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Services. Your use of the Services following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Contact<br>Questions, comments and requests regarding this Privacy Policy are welcomed and should be sent to: <a href="mailto:zzycn@2013.gmail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zzycn@2013.gmail</a>. Because email communications are not always secure, please do not include credit card or other sensitive information in your emails to us.</p>
